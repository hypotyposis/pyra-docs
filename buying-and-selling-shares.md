# Buying and Selling Shares

On Pyra, investors and fans can trade a creator by buying and selling shares of them. The value of a creator's shares is determined by the market and can go up or down based on a bonding curve. Creators can earn trading fees every time their shares are bought and sold.

## How to buy a creator's shares
1. Visit a creator's page. On the right side of the banner, you will see a `Trade Share` button. Share value and holders number are displayed below.
2. Click the `Trade Share` button. A dialog will pop up. Enter the number you want to buy, share price and total cost will be calculated automatically based on how many are currently circulating. You can buy as many shares as you want.
3. Click the `Buy` button and confirm the transaction in your wallet.
