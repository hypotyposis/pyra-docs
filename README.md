# What is Pyra?

Pyra aims to forge a new paradigm of creator economy with Web3 technologies and innovative tokenomics.  We managed to build a mutually beneficial triangle among creators, fans and investors.

* **Creators** - content creators, such as digital artists, X influencers, video creators, etc.
* **Fans** - content consumers, loyal to their favorite creators, willing to pay for rare contents.
* **Investors** - early supportors, find creators with potential to be popular and help grow their careers.

These 3 groups of people can overlap. On Pyra, creators, fans and investors engage in social and financial interactions, enabling creators to monetize their contents directly and fully harness the bussiness potential, while fans truly own what they bought and get rewards for early appreciation. Meanwhile, investors and creators collaborate to maximize profits.&#x20;
