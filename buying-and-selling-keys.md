# Buying and Selling Keys

On Pyra, fans needs to hold keys to access exclusive content from creators. Keys are non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that represent access to a creator's private content. There are different levels of rarity for keys, and the rarer the key, the more exclusive the content it unlocks.

## How to Buy a Key
1. Visit a creator's page. On the right side of the banner, you will see a `Trade Key` button. Key price and sales are displayed below.
2. Click the `Trade Key` button. A dialog will pop up. Select the tier you want to trade. You can only buy 1 key a time. Key price will be calculated automatically based on how many are currently circulating. 
3. Click the `Buy` button and confirm the transaction in your wallet.
