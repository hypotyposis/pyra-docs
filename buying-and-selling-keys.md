# Buying and Selling Keys

On Pyra, fans needs to hold keys to access exclusive content from creators. Keys are non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that represent access to a creator's private content. There are different levels of rarity for keys, and the rarer the key, the more exclusive the content it unlocks.

## How to Buy a Key
1. Visit a creator's page. On the right side of the banner, you will see a `Trade Share` button. Share value and holders number are displayed below.
1. Click the `Trade Share` button. A dialog will pop up. Enter the number you want to buy, share price and total cost will be calculated automatically based on how many are currently circulating. You can buy as many shares as you want.
2. Click the `Buy` button and confirm the transaction in your wallet.
