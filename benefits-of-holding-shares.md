# Benefits of Holding Shares

## Price Lifting
Early purchase of a creator will be rewarded with a lower price. As the creator's popularity grows, the price of the shares will increase. The earlier you buy, the more profit you will make.

## Staking Revenue
Holding shares of a creator will allow you to earn a portion of the creator's revenue. As a shareholder, you can choose to stake any amount of your shares and earn distributions from revenue generated by [Keys' sales](./buying-and-selling-keys.md). Staked shares will be locked in contracts and cannot be traded, but you can unstake them at any time.
